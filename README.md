# imagesketch

Create a sketch of an image. 

The program works by first generating a blank image. It then selects a shape, assigns it a random color from the source image, and compares it to the source image at a random x and y point. If the shape is closer to the source image at the point than what it currently on the blank png, it copies the shape to the png.
